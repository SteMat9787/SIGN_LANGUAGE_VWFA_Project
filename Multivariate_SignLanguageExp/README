%This is the folder with all the files for the multivariate experiment

In this folder there are:
1. SignExp_main_withTarget.m --> this is the script to run
2. Sign_Stimuli--> A folder with the videosfor the localizer  
3. output_files --> A folder where the output files generated running the main script will be created 

The output is:
1. a .csv file with the results for all the runs (here you find also runs that crashed or that stopped before the end)
2. a .mat file for each run (this is the output for the fMRI analysis)
