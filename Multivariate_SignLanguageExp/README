%This is the folder with all the files for the multivariate experiment

In this folder there are:
1. SignExp_main_withTarget.m --> this is the script to run
2. tsvwrite.m --> function usedd by the main script to cocnvert the .csv output to a .tsv file
3. Sign_Stimuli--> A folder with the videosfor the localizer  
4. output_files --> A folder where the output files generated running the main script will be created 

The output is:
1. a .csv file with the results for each run (here you find also runs that crashed or that stopped before the end)
2. a .tsv file with the results for each run (this is the output for the BIDS fMRI analysis)
3. a .mat file for each run (this is the old output for the fMRI analysis - not BIDS based)
