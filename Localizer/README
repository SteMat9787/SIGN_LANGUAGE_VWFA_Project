%This is the folder with the localizer.

In this folder there are:
1. signVWFA_localizer.m --> this is the script to run (press 's' when the message 'ready to start' appears)
2. tsvwrite.m --> function to convert the .csv output to a .tsv file BIDS compatible
3. Stimuli_3D --> A folder with the images for the localizer  (In this folder there is also a plot_stimuli.m script to  visualize the stimuli)
4. output_files --> A folder where the output files generated running the main script will be created 

The output is a folder named:'[subname]_3D_Onsetfiles' including:
1. a .csv file with the results for each run (here you find also runs that crashed or that stop before the end)
2. a .tsv file for BIDS analyses for each run
3. a .mat file for each run (this is the output for the fMRI analysis)
